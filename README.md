# versatile_torso_probot
There are several reasons to build a robot with humanoid form. It has been argued that to build a machine with human like intelligence, it must be embodied in a human like body. Others argue that for humans to interact naturally with a robot, it will be easier for the humans if that robot has humanoid form. A third, and perhaps more concrete, reasons for building a humanoid robot is to develop a machine that interacts naturally with human spaces; with the simpler versions of the humanoid turning out to be Torso robots or wheeled robots. The report presents one such technique to design the torso robot. The Programmable Robot (Pro-Bot) has the ability to move forward and backward, left &amp; right and to grip objects. The feature making the robot versatile is the adaptation to different modes of navigation techniques such as line following, wireless control and using programmed sequence.
